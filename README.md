This is a barebones implementation of genetic algorithm evolution to develop strategies for digital coin trading bot Gekko. [https://github.com/askmike/gekko]

It generates random configs, and evolve them by backtesting on a Gekko session via the REST API of gekko's user interface. Genetic algorithm and bayesian optimization are evolution choices.

Recommended usage:
```
Open two terminals;

T.1 -> run Gekko on ui mode, or just its webserver:
$node gekko.js --ui
or
$node web/server.js

T.2 -> $cd [japonicus dir]
       $python japonicus.py [-g|-b] [-c] [-k] [--repeat <X>] [ [-r|--strat <Strategy>] [-w]

    -g for genetic algorithm;
    -b for bayesian optimization;

    -c to use an alternative, experimental (probably weaker) genetic algorithm;

    -k launches a child gekko instance, so no need for the first terminal;
    
    -r run with random strategy
    --strat choose one strat to run [deprecated, set it on Settings.py];
    
    --repeat to run genetic algorithm X times; then just check evolution.log;

    -w launches a neat dash/flask web server @ your local machine, which can be accessed via  webbrowser.
           Address is shown on the first line of console output. (likely http://localhost:5000)


```
This is written on python because of the nice DEAP module for genetic algorithm, and was worth it. DEAP is available on PIP and required.

All settings are set at Settings.py;

If your Gekko UI http port is not :3000, adjust it;

Backtesting is parallel, running a pool of five workers, adjustable.


The full parallel backtesting is now complete. It sends backtest requests across the internet to several machines running Gekko.
Intended to use with Ansible-playbook + Amazon EC2 AWS machines. <br>
At japonicus side, you should provide Ansible's `hosts` inventory file path (on settings.generations), containing
the IPs of running machines (a simple list). <br>
Those machines should be already fully configured, running Gekko, and loaded with the same candlestick history data
files you have on local Gekko;<br>
I can't make a tutorial for this yet, anyone interested pm me. One AWS slave machine with same
capacity as local machine can cut EPOCH runningtimes to 66% the original time. Yet very experimental stuff...<br>
YML playbook file to get gekko running on Amazon AMI Linux is at root folder (set the path to your local gekko history @ line 57);


Known good gekko strategies to run with this (choose @ Settings.py):
 - PPO
 - RSI

Better avoid those:
- DEMA
- MACD


### Docker Compose

You can easily start japonicus by adding the following snippet to gekkos docker-compose file

```yml
  japonicus:
    build: relative-path-from-gekko-to-the-japonicus-repo/
    volumes:
      - ./volumes/gekko-japonicus:/usr/src/app/output
    links:
      - gekko
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
```

and by setting the `GekkoURLs` config to the container gekko name
```python
# Settings.py
'GekkoURLs': ['http://gekko:3000']
```

japonicus will choose a random item of the list to fetch candles and scansets.
